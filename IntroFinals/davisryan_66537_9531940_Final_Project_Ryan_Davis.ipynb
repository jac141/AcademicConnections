        "Other than making a new theme, I changed the code significantly from my adventure game to this game. I added more inputs and ways to make mistakes, to make the game more challenging and also more fun. I made two more passwords. For the first password, I made it so that the program would generate a random name and then the user would have to input this to survive. In addition, I. made a spam function so that the user could not just scroll up and see the answer to the password. I also made another knowledge password where the user must know that Owen Grady is Chris Pratt. In the end, I also added confetti with random colors to make a much better turtle graphic to congratulate the user after they win the game. "

To fix this I originally attempted to make the text erase after it had been printed. I experimented with this for a while but then concluded I could instead just make a loop to print a phrase many times to hide the response so the user could no longer access it. This was the purpose of my spam function. I would say that this was simpler because all I needed was a for loop instead of more complicated programming that would have needed to be imported to erase the text.\n",
